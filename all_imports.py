# dev note: I code & retrieve files from .env or such files, but you can also write the path on any file you want
# dev note: I also prefer to code different functionalities (plotting, analysis, libraries etc.) in separate files for better organization for larger projects.
# dev not: But! All can be done in a single file as well. Totally up to you. Have fun, do it your own style ^^.
